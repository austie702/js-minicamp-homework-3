# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
		// Data containing either properties (which are more like things or nouns, which themselves are made up of a key and a value pair), and methods (which are more like actions or verbs)
	* Properties
		// A property is a key-value pair inside of an object. The key being the name of the property, while the value is the data the key is storing. 
	* Methods
		// Functions inside of objects. Please refer to functions desc in Homework2.
	* for in loop
		// A way to say, "For everything in this thing" which is likely followed by "do the following."
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
		// Dot, as well as bracket-quote notation, either create a new property in an object, or they refer to a pre-exisiting property inside an object. Bracket notation (without the quotes) is a notation for referring to a specific variable somewhere else in the program, but invocation with bracket notation cannot create or find existing object props.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
